## What is Redux?

Redux is a **state management library** for JavaScript applications.  
It acts as a **central brain** for your app, storing all important data (state) in one place called the **store**, making state management predictable and easier to debug.

In a React app, for example, each component can have its own state. But as your app grows, sharing data between components becomes messy. Redux solves this by storing all state in a single place, called the store

**Analogy:**  
Imagine your app is a company. Components are employees. Each employee (component) could keep its own notes (state), but itâ€™s confusing if they all have different versions. Redux acts like the central office filing system, where all important information is stored and accessible to everyone

## Core Principles of Redux

Redux follows **three main principles**:

1. **Single Source of Truth**  
   - The entire app state is stored in a single store object.

2. **State is Read-Only**  
   - State cannot be modified directly; it changes only through **actions**.

3. **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**  
   - **Reducers** are pure functions that calculate new state from the current state and an action.

## Core Concepts

| Concept       | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Store**     | Holds the app state and allows reading, dispatching actions, and subscribing to changes. |
| **Action**    | A plain object describing what happened. Must have a `type` property, can have a payload. |
| **Reducer**   | A pure function that updates state based on the action. |
| **Dispatch**  | Sends an action to the store. |
| **Selector**  | Extracts specific parts of the state from the store. |


1. **Store**

The store is the central object holding the application state.

Responsibilities:
Hold the current state.
Allow reading the state.
Allow dispatching actions.
Allow subscribing to state changes.



2. **Action**

An action is a plain JavaScript object describing what happened.
Every action must have a type (a string), and it can optionally have a payload (data for the update).


## Example:
 
```javascript
{ type: 'INCREMENT' }   // simple action
{ type: 'ADD_TODO', payload: { id: 1, text: 'Learn Redux' } }
```

3. **Reducer**

A reducer is a function that determines how the state changes in response to an action.
It takes the current state and the action and returns a new state.


 ## Example:

```javascript
function counterReducer(state = { count: 0 }, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
```

4. **Dispatch**

The dispatch function sends an action to the store, which then calls the reducer.


Example:
```javascript

store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' });

```
5. **Selector**

A selector is a function that extracts specific parts of the state from the store.
This helps components access only the data they need.

## How Redux Works

1. **User triggers an event** (e.g., clicks a button)  
2. **Dispatch an action** describing what happened  
3. **Reducer calculates the new state** without modifying the old one  
4. **Store updates the state**  
5. **UI reacts** and renders based on the updated state

---

## Example: Counter App

```javascript

///////reducer.js///////////

// Initial state
const initialState = { count: 0 };

// Reducer
export default function counterReducer(state = initialState, action) {
  switch(action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      return state;
  }
}

/////////////store.js//////////

// Create store
import counterReducer from './reducer';
import { createStore } from 'redux';
const store = createStore(counterReducer);

// Subscribe to state changes
store.subscribe(() => console.log(store.getState()));



///////////index.js////////////    entry point of the app

import store from './store';
// Dispatch actions
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }); // { count: 1 }
store.dispatch({ type: 'INCREMENT' }); // { count: 2 }
store.dispatch({ type: 'DECREMENT' }); // { count: 1 }

```

## Why Use Redux?

  1. Predictable state updates: Every change goes through actions and reducers.
  2. Centralized state: Easy to share data across components.
  3. Debugging is easier: DevTools let you track every state change over time.
  4. Middleware support: Handle asynchronous tasks like API calls using tools like redux-thunk or redux-saga.

## Redux Toolkit (Modern Redux)

Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux setup and reduces boilerplate:


```javascript


import { createSlice, configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState: { count: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: state => { state.count += 1 },
    decrement: state => { state.count -= 1 },
  },
});

const store = configureStore({ reducer: counterSlice.reducer });

store.dispatch(counterSlice.actions.increment());
console.log(store.getState()); // { count: 1 }

```

1. (createSlice) combines actions and reducers in one place.
2. State updates can be written mutably thanks to Immer.js under the hood.
